# string-utils
A simple, single header, basic string manipulation library for C++.
Please use atleast C++11 (Tested with C++14)

## Why?
C++ STL's strings are known for being just *meh*, so I decided to make this small library to help with tedious tasks like to_string() and stuff like that.

## Usage
Just include the header file, and use the functions whitin the "string" namespace, every function is *slightly* documented and it's kinda self-explaining (this time for real).

## Contributing
I would love if someone better than me at C++ wants to help out the library, just open a PR!
